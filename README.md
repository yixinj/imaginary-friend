# Lula
## Node.js, Express, Python, Google Web Speech API for MedHacks 2018

Lula the Narwhal is a digital friend your child can speak with. The app continuously takes in audio and runs sentiment analysis on your child's speech patterns, looking for common words and phrases associated with distress or mental disorders in children. If the app determines that your child's speech is concerning, it sends you a text with what was said and what disorders or problems it may be linked with.

Lula the Narwhal is meant to be used as a lightweight, early diagnostic tool for potential mental disorders. It's based on the premise that early detection and treatment improve outcomes, and that certain speech patterns can be predictive of certain conditions. Speech patterns used in analysis are pulled from data sets from children with depression and anxiety.
